ok so this is the plan for now 

i have made the first draft of the dfs client 
now all that is left is to make the interfaces to communicate with the client 

i have planned two interfaces 
1) cli 
2) web 



the web client will be the main thig for now 



in the coming 4 days i will complete the web interface 



the plan is to implement a rpc-based communication with the frontend(react) and the backend(rust).
